# Predicting Website Churn Through Seasonal Time Series Decomposition of Traffic Data

## Overview

This project analyzes website traffic data to identify seasonal patterns that correlate with user churn.  By decomposing the time series data into its constituent components (trend, seasonality, and residuals), we aim to predict periods of increased churn risk and inform proactive retention strategies.  The analysis utilizes statistical methods to uncover these patterns and provide actionable insights.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Statsmodels
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The script will process the input data (assumed to be in a CSV file specified within `main.py`), perform the time series decomposition, and generate the analysis output.

## Example Output

The script will print a summary of the analysis to the console, including key statistical findings related to seasonal patterns and their relationship with churn.  Additionally, the script generates several visualization files (e.g., plots showing the decomposed time series components, trend analysis, seasonal components, etc.). These plots are saved in the `output` directory and provide a visual representation of the identified seasonal patterns and their impact on website traffic and potential churn.  The exact filenames of these plots may vary, but they will be clearly labeled and informative.  For example, you might find files such as `seasonal_decomposition.png`, `trend_analysis.png`, and `residual_analysis.png`.


## Data

The project requires a CSV file containing website traffic data with at least a timestamp column and a column indicating user counts or other relevant metrics.  The exact format of this file is specified and handled within the `main.py` script.  You may need to modify `main.py` to point to your specific data file location.
